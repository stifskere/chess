# CHESS â™Ÿ

(not to be confused with the word [cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese))

This chess is made with c++ 17 and [sfml](https://www.sfml-dev.org) for windows.

## Downloads

Just head to the releases page to download a statically compiled version,

or if you want to build it yourself with `cmake` you need to make sure to install [sfml](https://www.sfml-dev.org) before that.

## Modifications

You can change all the images in the [`pieces`](https://github.com/stifskere/chess/tree/main/cmake-build-debug/pieces) folder, just don't change image names, any image modification must be `60px x 60px`

If you want to change the table layout, modify the [`table.tbs`](https://github.com/stifskere/chess/blob/main/cmake-build-debug/table.tbs) file
