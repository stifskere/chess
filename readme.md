Just head to the releases page to download a staticaly compiled version,

or if you want to build it yourself with `cmake` you need to make sure to install [sfml](https://www.sfml-dev.org) before that.

## Modifications

You can change all the images in the "pieces" folder, just don't change image names, any image modification must be `60px x 60px`

#### default image names

for reference prefix b means black and prefix w means white, if any image is missing game might not run correctly or even start.
